This is a file compressor using Huffman compression. To use,
simply run make and you should now get applications compress
and uncompress.

compress <filetobecompressed> <nameofcompressedfile>
uncompress <nameofcompressedfile> <filetobeuncompressed>

There are much better compressors out there and this is not
optimized as the header size is always fixed regardless of
incidence of bytes. Don't hurt me.
